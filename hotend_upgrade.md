# All Metal Hotend Install
The Kobra 2 comes with a proprietary PTFE-lined hotend that is slow to heat up and easy to clog. It's flow rate is around the normal volcano flow rate, which is 20 mm^3/s with a 0.4mm nozzle, but cannot be upgraded with a CHT or CHT clone nozzle because of the proprietary design. The heat block's method for clamping the heater into place is suboptimal and leads to slow heat ups. The PTFE lining limits the hotend to about 250c because at higher temperatures the PTFE will produce toxic fumes. Anycubic's proprietary nozzles are only available in 0.4 size as of right now, and are sold at a completely overpriced $2.60 for a standard brass nozzle. Overall, the hotend is subpar, with poor compatibility and features.

This upgrade will attempt to fix all of these issues. We will be installing a regular volcano PT100 heat block, bimetal heatbreak, and clone CHT volcano nozzle for about $15. Combined, this will raise the max flow rate to ~26mm^3/s and max temperature to >300c. The new hotend will also be compatible with standard volcano nozzles, which makes the cost of replacing nozzles much lower and gives more options in nozzle material and diameter.

### Notes:
- This guide assumes you have already installed Klipper and have knowlege of the parts of a hotendd
- I am not sponsored by any of these sellers that I have provided links to. I have mostly chosen these products because they're the cheapest that are compatible
- Any v5 style bimetal heatbreak will do. The one I chose is excellent and I haven't had any problems so far
- The volcano heat blocks come in many materials. I chose plated copper, but aluminum should work fine
- Either volcano PT100 or standard volcano heatblock should work, although I haven't tested the regular volcano. The installation may look different for the standard volcano, as this guide was written for the PT100 version. The PT100 version is a tight fit however, so if you're confident in your abilites to assemble a hotend, go with the standard version. 
- If you plan to print abrasives, get the hardened steel clone CHT nozzles. They may impact your flow rate negataively, but the impact should be small because the main limiter to heat transfer is the thermal conductivity of the plastic itself and not the nozzle. Hardened steel will allow for a much longer lifespan when printing abrasives and is highly recommended. 
- While standard volcano nozzles work, there's no reason to not get CHT nozzles IMO. They offer much higher flow for a small price increase.
- I would recommend using a sock. The fan ducts aren't very well designed and end up cooling the heat block a lot, although the 60w included heater cartrige can keep up with it. 

## Installation Instructions
1. ### Remove the old hotend
This involves taking off the hotend cover/fan duct, loosening the grub screws holding the heatbreak in place, and unplugging the thermistor and heater wires. [Anycubic's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=17&v=Y0PCCx-E9wk&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) covers this from 0:20 to 1:05.  

2. ### Thermistor and Heater Cartridge
Remove the thermistor and heater cartridge. This step is the trickiest out of the 3. While the thermistor is quite easy to remove, the heater cartridge can be a little finicky. It's held in place by a grub screw, but plastic can get in between the heater block and the heater and "glue" it into place. To get it out loosen the grub screw, heat the hotend up to 300c while it's still plugged in but hanging from the wires, and then while holding the heatbreak with a pair of pliers push the heater cartridge out slowly from the bottom. Once the cartridge is out, turn off the heater immediately to prevent oxidization of the steel. Turn off the printer. If there's any plastic on the cartridge, scrub it off gently with steel wool until the cartridge is clean. The thermistor is held in place with a single screw at the top of the heat block and can be removed by taking out the screw. Once done, make sure both the thermistor and heater cartridge are clean and set them aside for step 4. 

3. ### PTFE tube cutting
Cut the PTFE tube that was inside the stock hotend. Depending on the heatbreak, the amount to cut will vary. ![](/PTFE_CUTTING.png) Start by sticking the PTFE tube as far as it will go into the stock heatbreak and measuring the amount that sticks out. Then, repeat this with the new heatbreak. Subtract the amount that sticks out from the new heatbreak by the amount that sticks out of the stock heatbreak and cut off that much of the PTFE. This should result in the PTFE sticking out of the new heatbreak by the same amount as with the original stock heatbreak and uncut PTFE. To verify, place the PTFE and heatbreak together into the heatsink and ensure the copper part of the heatbreak sits flush in the heatsink. ![](/heatbreak_inserted.png) You shouldn't be able to see the copper from the side at all. Once verified, take the heatbreak out. 

4. ### Hotend assembly
Screw the heatbreak into the heat block until the threaded part sits a little lower than the top surface of the heat block. Make sure to screw the heatbreak onto the top side of the heat block, which is the non-flat side. Then screw in the nozzle from the other side and ensure that the nozzle is tightened against the heatbreak and not the heat block. Verify this by checking for a little bit of room in between the nozzle and the bottom side of the heat block. ![](/hotend_assembly.png) Make sure not to have too much of the nozzle sticking out that can cause it to clog. Aim for around a 0.5mm gap. Next, install the thermistor. For the PT100 version, there are 2 non-threaded holes: a small one and a bigger one. The thermistor goes into the small one, and the heater cartridge goes into the big one. When installing the thermistor, make sure that the thermistor is at the depth of the grub screw that holds it into place, and tighten the grub screw. Install the heater cartridge in the bigger hole and clamp it down with the screws on the side. This will cause the heat block to bend slightly, but that is intentional and makes the heater have better contact. Make sure both the thermistor and heater wires are facing towards the heatbreak and not the nozzle. 

5. ### Final assembly
Put the hotend assembly into place by sliding the heatbreak(with PTFE tube inserted) into the heatsink and make sure that the copper part of the heatbreak still sits flush with the heatsink. Optionally, add some cpu thermal paste on the outside of the copper part of the heatbreak before inserting to get better heat transfer. Tighten the grub screws and do another check to ensure the copper part of the heatbreak is flush with the heatsink. Route the wires to the breakout board and plug them back in. This is covered in 1:07 to 1:50 in the same [Anycubic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=17&v=Y0PCCx-E9wk&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) mentioned in step 1. 

6. ### Checks and tuning
Turn on the printer and try heating up the hotend. If you get a thermal runaway error or "ADC out of range", check your wiring to make sure everything is plugged in right. Next, heat the hotend up to 260c and hot tighten the nozzle. Try extruding some filament. It should flow extremly easily and straight out of the nozzle. If you have a sock, this the time to put it back on. You should check and readjust the z offset in case the upgraded hotend is a different length than the stock one. It's better to check now than to end up with a damaged build plate or a spaghetti faliure. PID tune your hotend in it's usual use scenario to ensure temperature stability and fast heating. If you run 100% part fan and a sock, then tune with 100% fan and a sock. If you run 15% fan with no sock, PID tune with 15% fan and no sock. PID tune at the usuall temperature you print at as well. I usually print ABS at 250 and 15% fan without a sock, so that's what I would PID tune with. After that, save_config and you're good to go! Enjoy the extra flow rate - 24 mm^3/s should be a safe limit for PLA at 220c or ABS at 250c.
